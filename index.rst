Updater 0.1 documentation
------------------------------------

`Updater <https://github.com/mcv-software/updater>`_ Is a python module to perform automatic updates of distribution binaries in user machines. This module has been forked from the `app_updater module <https://github.com/accessibleapps/app_updater>`_ and extended to our needs at `MCV Software <https://mcvsoftware.com>`_ by providing a new mechanism to communicate update progress and decoupling the Graphical User Interface from the module logic.

Note: This module is under active development. Currently we are in the process of adding implementations (or updater classes) that will provide support to a variety of user interfaces, but this is not complete yet.
